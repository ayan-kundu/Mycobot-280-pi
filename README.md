# Mycobot-280-pi
## Operating Mycobot {{ Beginers' tutorial and demonstrations }}

#### Beginerâ€™s dir:-

This directory is for those who are starting their journey with Mycobot. It is not necessary to state that the code is applicable to Mycobot M and pi series without any change required.
 
**In this repo you will find-**
1. how to set up the robot
2. how to set it ready for programming
3. How to programe it both using myblockly and python(in case you are more familiar with)
4. Two operations I came up while I was at beginers' stage e.g. Fanning and dancing . Alongside you will be able to familiarise yourself how to make several meaning ful poses.

>All detailed instructions are stated here with clean code and visualisation and demonstrations. The hard coding which let the robot do some interesting tasks like : Fanning and later on dancing and so on are amazing to start up with. 

>I Made these because there is no well-detailed or structured GitHub or even online tutorial(except some random mycobot videos) based on how mycobot can be operated and letter on implemented with LfD(refer to Learning from Demonstation repo) to deliver an AI task .

- [ ] I hope you will come up with your own ideas, so crack on and enjoy!:+1:

Mycobot doing tasks->
	
	Chinese Pose:
By hard coding it is possible with the robot to make some Chinese pose which carries meaning in it e.g Lucy pose etc.

	Fanning:
It is able to move in a rhythmic way both horizontally and vertically synced that makes a fanning effect when a flat surface/fan is attached to the end effector.

	Dancing:
This is inspired by a YouTube video where the robot was made to swing side-by-side. It is hard programmed in a combination of some flexible poses that give it a dancing movement. It seems really nice when you run the code playing a music in background.
