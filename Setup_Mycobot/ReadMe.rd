## How to set up the robot =>

1. **Set up:**

  1.Firstly, power on the robot with the charger.

  2.Secondly, if it is M series you need to connect your computer with the robot base otherwise with pi series use the cdmi cable to connect the robot with a monitor. In pi series you just need a monitor to see what is happening in the robot, a keyboard connected to the base to program it and a mouse to navigate across the monitor.
  3. Next, calibrate the joints(match the zero points) or set all the joint angles=[0,0,0,0,0,0]. You will see the ATOM LCD lit up
  4. All set now! 

2. Check Physical Connectivity:

> Requirements for Mycobot pi:
A monitor, key board, mouse, HDMI cable
Requirements for Mycobot M:
An external computer (usb 2.0(computer side) to usb C(robot base side))

3. Software Connectivity:
Mycobot M series requites burn the Basic and Atom whereas you gotta burn the Atom only in case of pi series.
> Please refer this to burn ->
4. Ready for operation: :tada:
As you realise now that in case of M series you need an external system to code/program the robot but with pi you do not require any external computing system attached to it. 
5. Open myBolockly if you are comfortable with that. If you are familiar with python you can write your code in editor (downloadable) and run it through terminal.
